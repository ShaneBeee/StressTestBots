# Minecraft Bot Stress Tester
A simple app used to stress test Minecraft servers by loading in fake players (bots).

This is a fork of the [**original**](https://github.com/crpmax/mc-bots) with a big re-write to the codebase, along with a built in plugin that can be directly used on the server.

# Usage:
There are two different ways you can use this, either as a standalone app run from a console, or by adding it to your server and running as a plugin.

To use as a standalone app, see the [**standalone wiki**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/mc-bots/wiki/Standalone)

To use as a plugin on your server, see [**plugin wiki**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/mc-bots/wiki/Plugin)

# Requirements:
- Java 17+
